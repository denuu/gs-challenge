# Todo
A multi-user live to-do list using socket.io. Responsive, clean, and easy to use!

## Set Up
This is a Node app so you'll need Node and NPM to get it up on its feet.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Navigate here to get the app running
```
http://localhost:3003/
```
Navigate in two browsers, or one browser in regular and private/incognito windows to test user exchangeable todos!

## Enjoy!
This was a phenomenally fun project to work on to code with sockets.
